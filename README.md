# Flight Delay & Cancellation Predictor

This project was developed for STAT 628 at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. We use historical flight data and weather data to build predictive models for U.S. domestic flights. The Shiny application allows users to input flight details and receive predictions about:

- Whether their flight will be cancelled  
- Whether their flight will depart or arrive on time  
- If delayed, the expected delay time  
- Uncertainties associated with each prediction  

## Project Scope

Our analysis includes all U.S. domestic flights from **May to August 2024**, covering all airlines and airports.

## Features

- Predict flight cancellation, departure delay, and arrival delay  
- Weather features (snowfall, rainfall, temperature, wind speed) are used when available  
- The model automatically excludes weather features when the prediction is more than 7 days in advance  
- Built using R, Python and Shiny  

## Folder Structure

- `code/` â€” all scripts and code used in the project  
- `data/` â€” preprocessed and sample datasets used in modeling  
- `docs/` â€” documents such as the executive summary and technical report  

Due to file size limitations on GitHub, **full datasets are stored on Google Drive**:
